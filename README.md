Hello there!

I'm Andrea GonzÃ¡lez, and I work in macroeconomic research, specializing in monetary policy issues across Latin American emerging economies. In a world gravitating to work with big data, I seek to make the most out of scarce and often fragmented official datasets, where missing observations, abrupt methodological changes, and hard-to-reach official releases tend to be the norm. While this could be often seen as a limitation, working with far-from-pristine data has taught me discipline, precision, and the importance of leaving a well-documented replicable trail. 

I'm working on: 

- Macroeconomic forecast evaluation,
- Inflationary pressures stemming from labor markets with substantial informal sectors.
