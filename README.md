## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andrea GonzÃ¡lez**, and I work in macroeconomic research, specializing in **monetary policy issues** across **Latin American emerging economies**. In a world gravitating to work with big data, I seek to **make the most out of scarce and often fragmented official datasets**, where missing observations, abrupt methodological changes, and hard-to-reach official releases tend to be the norm. While this could be often seen as a limitation, working with far-from-pristine data has taught me discipline, precision, and the importance of leaving a well-documented replicable trail.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- ðŸ§® **Macroeconomic forecast evaluation**  
- ðŸ’¼ **Inflationary pressures from labor markets with high informality rates**

### ðŸŽ¾ On the side:
In my free time, I also enjoy wrangling data for **tennis analytics**.
